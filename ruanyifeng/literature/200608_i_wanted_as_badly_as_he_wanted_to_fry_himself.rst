Brendan
O’Kane在他的\ `中文Blog <http://www.bokane.org/chinese/2006/08/17/lan/>`__\ 上，贴出了美国20年代的专栏作家Don
Marquis的一首打油诗的翻译，非常值得一看。

**蛾的启示**

the lesson of the moth

作者：Don Marquis

译者：Brendan O’Kane

| 那晚跟飞蛾聊天
|  他正试着破灯而入
|  自炸于电丝上

| i was talking to a moth the other evening he was trying to break into
|  an electric light bulb
|  and fry himself on the wires

| 你们这帮家伙 何必这样恶搞 我问他 循蛾的惯例 还是非得如此 若是裸烛
你们早已成了煤渣
|  难道竟没有
|  这样基本的常识

| why do you fellows pull this stunt i asked him because it is the
conventional thing for moths or why if that had been an uncovered candle
instead of an electric light bulb you would
|  now be a small unsightly cinder
|  have you no sense

| （常识）有的是 他说 不过有时 我们厌腻了循常 宁愿尝试 刺激和美丽
火焰是美丽的 万一靠得太近 会遭其杀戮 可又如何呢 一刻的幸福
然后与美丽同焚 比百岁和一世的无聊 要好得多 所以我们将岁月集成
就像成一卷钱 然后将钱赌光 生命便是如此 成为一场美丽的局部然后逝去
总比完整的存活 而从不跟美丽联络 要好得多 我们对生命的态度
就是来时从容去时淡定
|  自若得如人类
|  文明得不知所措以前的样子

| plenty of it he answered but at times we get tired of using it we get
bored with the routine and crave beauty and excitement fire is beautiful
and we know that if we get too close it will kill us but what does that
matter it is better to be happy for a moment and be burned up with
beauty than to live a long time and be bored all the while so we wad all
our life up into one little roll and then we shoot the roll that is what
life is for it is better to be a part of beauty for one instant and then
cease to exist than to exist forever and never be a part of beauty our
attitude toward life is come easy go easy we are like human beings
|  used to be before they became
|  too civilized to enjoy themselves

| 不等我说服他自己的哲学是错误的 他就去了 在雪茄打火机的焰上自焚
我并不同意他 我自己还是宁愿有
|  一半的幸福和两倍的
|  长寿

| and before i could argue him out of his philosophy he went and
immolated himself on a patent cigar lighter i do not agree with him
myself i would rather have
|  half the happiness and twice
|  the longevity

| 只是同时 我但愿有
|  如他对自焚
|  一样的渴求

| but at the same time i wish
|  there was something i wanted
|  as badly as he wanted to fry himself
