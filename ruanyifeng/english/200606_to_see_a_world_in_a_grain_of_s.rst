威廉·布莱克《从一颗沙子看世界》（To see a world in a grain of sand）

威廉·布莱克（William
Blake）是18世纪末、19世纪初的一个英国诗人，活着的时候没人知道，直到20世纪初才被挖掘出来。他在国内最出名就是下面四行诗：

| To see a world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower,
|  Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
|  And eternity in an hour.

这四行诗的中译，我估计至少有二三十种。下面选贴几种。

| 一沙见世界, 一花窥天堂.
|  手心握无限,
|  须臾纳永恒.

——译者不详

| 在一颗沙粒中见一个世界， 在一朵鲜花中见一片天空，
在你的掌心里把握无限， 在一个钟点里把握无穷。
|  　　
|  ——《布莱克诗集》上海三联，张炽恒译

| 从一粒沙看世界， 从一朵花看天堂，
|  把永恒纳进一个时辰，
|  把无限握在自己手心。

——王佐良

| 一花一世界， 一沙一天国，
|  君掌盛无边，
|  刹那含永劫。

——宗白华

| 一颗沙里看出一个世界 一朵野花里一座天堂
|  把无限放在你的手掌上
|  永恒在一刹那里收藏

——《世界上最美丽的英文——人生短篇》

但是，这几行诗在欧美并不是那么有名，讲起布莱克的时候，也不把这看作他的代表作。似乎只有中国人才特别迷恋这几句话，我猜想也许因为这首诗跟佛教思想有相通之处有关系。

这四行诗选自一首长达132行、名为《天真的预兆》（Auguries of
Innocence）的长诗，是开头四行。这首长诗似乎并不重要，没有收在布莱克主要几本诗集里，评论家也不谈，我在网上甚至找不到它是写于哪一年的。

这首长诗通篇的风格与前四行诗很吻合，都是那种含有哲理的格言诗，总得来说很费解。越到后面越难理解，我读了几遍，都没有看明白。

**William Blake - Auguries of Innocence**

| To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower,
|  Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
|  And eternity in an hour.

| A robin redbreast in a cage
|  Puts all heaven in a rage.

| A dove-house fill’d with doves and pigeons Shudders hell thro’ all its
regions.
|  A dog starv’d at his master’s gate
|  Predicts the ruin of the state.

| A horse misused upon the road Calls to heaven for human blood.
|  Each outcry of the hunted hare
|  A fibre from the brain does tear.

| A skylark wounded in the wing, A cherubim does cease to sing.
|  The game-cock clipt and arm’d for fight
|  Does the rising sun affright.

| Every wolf’s and lion’s howl
|  Raises from hell a human soul.

| The wild deer, wand’ring here and there, Keeps the human soul from
care.
|  The lamb misus’d breeds public strife,
|  And yet forgives the butcher’s knife.

| The bat that flits at close of eve Has left the brain that won’t
believe.
|  The owl that calls upon the night
|  Speaks the unbeliever’s fright.

| He who shall hurt the little wren Shall never be belov’d by men.
|  He who the ox to wrath has mov’d
|  Shall never be by woman lov’d.

| The wanton boy that kills the fly Shall feel the spider’s enmity.
|  He who torments the chafer’s sprite
|  Weaves a bower in endless night.

| The caterpillar on the leaf Repeats to thee thy mother’s grief.
|  Kill not the moth nor butterfly,
|  For the last judgement draweth nigh.

| He who shall train the horse to war Shall never pass the polar bar.
|  The beggar’s dog and widow’s cat,
|  Feed them and thou wilt grow fat.

| The gnat that sings his summer’s song Poison gets from slander’s
tongue.
|  The poison of the snake and newt
|  Is the sweat of envy’s foot.

| The poison of the honey bee
|  Is the artist’s jealousy.

| The prince’s robes and beggar’s rags Are toadstools on the miser’s
bags.
|  A truth that’s told with bad intent
|  Beats all the lies you can invent.

| It is right it should be so; Man was made for joy and woe;
|  And when this we rightly know,
|  Thro’ the world we safely go.

| Joy and woe are woven fine, A clothing for the soul divine.
|  Under every grief and pine
|  Runs a joy with silken twine.

| The babe is more than swaddling bands; Every farmer understands.
|  Every tear from every eye
|  Becomes a babe in eternity;

| This is caught by females bright, And return’d to its own delight.
|  The bleat, the bark, bellow, and roar,
|  Are waves that beat on heaven’s shore.

| The babe that weeps the rod beneath Writes revenge in realms of death.
|  The beggar’s rags, fluttering in air,
|  Does to rags the heavens tear.

| The soldier, arm’d with sword and gun, Palsied strikes the summer’s
sun.
|  The poor man’s farthing is worth more
|  Than all the gold on Afric’s shore.

| One mite wrung from the lab’rer’s hands Shall buy and sell the miser’s
lands;
|  Or, if protected from on high,
|  Does that whole nation sell and buy.

| He who mocks the infant’s faith Shall be mock’d in age and death.
|  He who shall teach the child to doubt
|  The rotting grave shall ne’er get out.

| He who respects the infant’s faith Triumphs over hell and death.
|  The child’s toys and the old man’s reasons
|  Are the fruits of the two seasons.

| The questioner, who sits so sly, Shall never know how to reply.
|  He who replies to words of doubt
|  Doth put the light of knowledge out.

| The strongest poison ever known Came from Caesar’s laurel crown.
|  Nought can deform the human race
|  Like to the armour’s iron brace.

| When gold and gems adorn the plow, To peaceful arts shall envy bow.
|  A riddle, or the cricket’s cry,
|  Is to doubt a fit reply.

| The emmet’s inch and eagle’s mile Make lame philosophy to smile.
|  He who doubts from what he sees
|  Will ne’er believe, do what you please.

| If the sun and moon should doubt, They’d immediately go out.
|  To be in a passion you good may do,
|  But no good if a passion is in you.

| The whore and gambler, by the state Licensed, build that nation’s
fate.
|  The harlot’s cry from street to street
|  Shall weave old England’s winding-sheet.

| The winner’s shout, the loser’s curse,
|  Dance before dead England’s hearse.

| Every night and every morn Some to misery are born,
|  Every morn and every night
|  Some are born to sweet delight.

| Some are born to sweet delight,
|  Some are born to endless night.

| We are led to believe a lie When we see not thro’ the eye,
|  Which was born in a night to perish in a night,
|  When the soul slept in beams of light.

| God appears, and God is light, To those poor souls who dwell in night;
|  But does a human form display
|  To those who dwell in realms of day.
