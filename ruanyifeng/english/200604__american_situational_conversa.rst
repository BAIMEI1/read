今天，意外发现《美国日常口语
情景会话实践》一书的内容已经全部上了网。这本书我在大学里认真学过，感觉是很好的口语教材。

它的特点是列出了44个日常生活中的情景。每个情景中有4段对话，16个句子，采用A和B一问一答的形式。任何一段中A的第一句话都可以用任何一段中B的第一句话回答，同样的，任何A的第二句话也可以和任何B的第二句话组合在一起。所以，实际上每一段的表达方式一共有256种。

by letters, post cards, short notes or phone calls.

| 1.A: I’ve come to say goodbye. B: When are you off? A: I’m flying home
on Sunday afternoon.

|  A: Goodbye. Hope to see you again next year.

**(5).Saying Thank You 道谢**

When someone invites you for dinner, you can bring flowers,candy or a
bottle of wine. Sometimes people send a thank you note to the host or
hostess a few days after the event.

| 1.A: I’d better be going. B: So soon? Why don’t you stay a little
longer? A: I wish I could, but it’s already late. B: Oh, it’s a shame
that you have to leave.
|  A: Thank you for a wonderful meal.
|  B: I’m glad you enjoyed it.

| 2.A: I really must be going now. B: But you just got here. Can’t you
stay a little longer? A: That’s very nice of you, but I really can’t. B:
Well, it’s too bad that you have to go.

have more coffee? A: I’d love to, but I have to get up early tomorrow.

for the road. A: No. Thanks all the same. B: Well, I’m sorry you have to
leave so early.
|  A: Thank you very much. We really had a good time.
|  B: Well, thank you for coming.

**(6).Asking People to Repeat 请人复述**

As long as you ask politely, most people do not mind repeating something
you didn’t hear or understand.

| 1.A: I’m sorry, but I didn’t catch what you said. B: I said, “Do you
want me to help you?”
|  A: If you’re sure you’re not in a hurry, I can use a lttle help.
|  B: Would you like me to get you a cab?

| 2.A: I beg your pardon? B: I said, “Do you need any help?”
|  A: That’s very nice of you. I guess I could use some help.
|  B: Just tell me what you’d like me to do.

| 3.A: What was that? B: I said, “Is there anything I can do?”
|  A: If it’s not too much trouble, I would like some help.
|  B: It’s no trouble at all. I’ll carry this suitcase for you.

| 4.A: Excuse me? I didn’t hear what you said. B: I asked you if you
wanted some help.
|  A: If you wouldn’t mind, I could use a hand.
|  B: I’ll get this bag for you.

**(7).Asking Favors 求助**

When you ask for things, it is important to be polite. The intonation
that you use in making your request is as important as what you actually
say. When you think someone will refuse your request, you can ask the
question in such a way that the refusal does not cause embarrassment.

| 1. A: Is there any chance of my borrowing your type-writer? B: For how
long?
|  A: Until the end of the week.
|  B: Yes, I guess that would be all right.

| 2. A: Would you mind if I borrowed your car? B: Well, when exactly?
|  A: Until Monday or Tuesday of next week.
|  B: I’m sorry, but it’s just not possible.

| 3. A: Do you think you could lend me some of your records? B: Until
when?
|  A: Oh, just over the holidays.
|  B: I’m not sure. I’ll have to think about it.

| 4. A: I was wondering if you’d let me stay with you for a few days. B:
It really depends on when.
|  A: Until next weekend, if that’s OK.
|  B: Let me think it over, and I’ll let you know later.

**(8).Giving Compliments 赞美**

Friends often compliment one another on clothes, especially if the
clothes are new.

| 1.A: What a beautiful sweater! B: Do you think it looks good on me? A:
Yes, and it goes beautifully with your pants.
|  B: You won’t believe it, but it was really cheap.
|  A: I wish I could find one just like it.

| 2.A: I like your new coat. B: Do you think it fits OK? A: Yes. It
looks terrific!
|  B: I bought it at half price.
|  A: You were lucky to find it.

| 3.A: That’s a very nice jacket. B: Does it really look OK? A: Yes, and
I like the color too. It matches your hat.
|  B: And I got it on sale.
|  A: That’s incredible!

| 4.A: I love that shirt. B: Do you really like it? A: Yes, it fits
perfectly.
|  B: It wasn’t very expensive either.
|  A: That’s amazing! It sure looks expensive.

**(9).Apologizing 道歉**

Sometimes it is necessary to tell someone bad news gently.

| 1.A: I’m afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth. B: Oh, don’t worry
about it.
|  A: I want to apologize. Is there anything I can do?
|  B: Just forget about it. I never did like it anyway.

| 2.A: I’m really sorry, but I seem to have misplaced your scarf. B: Oh,
that’s all right.
|  A: I’m very sorry. Can I get you another one?
|  B: No. Forget about it. It’s not important.

| 3.A: I’m sorry, but I can’t find the book you lent me. B: That’s OK.
|  A: I really feel bad about it. Let me buy you a new one.
|  B: No. Don’t be silly. I wouldn’t dream of letting you do that.

| 4.A: I feel terrible, but I’ve just broken your ashtray. B: It’s
nothing to get upset about.
|  A: I don’t know what to say. I’d like to replace it.
|  B: No. It’s out of the question.

**(10).Complaining 抱怨**

It’s a good idea to be as polite as possible even when complaining about
something.

| 1.A: I wish you wouldn’t play the TV so loud. B: Sorry. Where you
trying to sleep?
|  A: Yes, And while I think of it, please ask when you want to borrow
my records.
|  B: I’m sorry. You’re right. I should have asked.

| 2.A: Do you think you could keep the noise down? B: I’m sorry. Am I
keeping you awake?
|  A: Yes. And another thing, would you mind not making long distance
calls.
|  B: I’m sorry. I thought you wouldn’t mind.

| 3.A: That radio’s pretty loud. Could you turn it down, please? B:
Sorry. Was I disturbing you?
|  A: Yes. And something else, please don’t borrow my clothes without
asking.
|  B: Sorry. I guess I wasn’t thinking. I won’t do it again.

| 4.A: You don’t have to play that record so loud, do you? B: I’m sorry.
Has it been bothering you?
|  A: Yes. And please ask me the next time you want to use something.
|  B: I’m sorry. I meant to ask you.

| 
| **(11).The weather 天气**

A very common way to start a conversation is to talk about the weather.
When you’re traveling, remember that there is considerable variation in
climate in the United States.

| 1.A: Beautiful day, isn’t it? B: Yes, it’s not like what the radio
said at all.
|  A: I wish it would stay this way for the weekend.
|  B: As long as it doesn’t snow!

| 2.A: It seems to be clearing up. B: It’s such a nice change.
|  A: I really don’t think this weather will last.
|  B: Let’s just hope it doesn’t get cold again.

| 3.A: It looks it’s going to be sunny. B: Yes, it’s much better than
yesterday.
|  A: They say we’re going to get some rain later.
|  B: Oh, let’s just hope it stays warm.

| 4.A: I think it’s going to be a nice day. B: It’s certainly a big
improvement over yesterday.
|  A: But it’s supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon.
|  B: Well,the worst of the winter should be over.

**(12).Asking for Change 换零钱**

It is sometimes difficult toget change without buying something, so it’s
a good idea to carry change with you at all times. If you need change,
you can buy something inexpensive like candy or a newspaper and ask for
the coins you need.

| 1.A: Excuse me, but could you give me some change? B: Let me see. Are
dimes and quarters OK?
|  A: I want to make a long distance phone call.
|  B: Then you’ll need small change.

| 2.A: Sorry to bother you, but do you have change for a one? B: I’ll
have to look. What do you want it for?
|  A: I need it for the parking meter.
|  B: I can give you quarters, if that’ll help.

| 3.A: Pardon me, but I was wondering if you could break a one. B: Let
me look. What do you need?
|  A: I need the change for the stamp machine.
|  B: I think dimes and quarters will do.

| 4.A: Excuse me, could you give me change for a dollar? B: I’ll see
what I have. What do you need it for?
|  A: I want to get cigarettes.
|  B: You can use quarters, dimes and nickels.

**(13).Making a Telephone Call 打电话(1)**

| The telephone system in the United States, as in many other countries,
has a special number for each region of the country. It is called as
“area code”. If you know the area code and the phone number, it’s
usually cheaper to dial the number yourself. Of course, you must go
through an operator to make person-to-person or cllect calls. You can
dial direct to many countries
|  overseas or you can ask for the overseas operator.

| 1.A:Operator. B:I’d like to make a collect call to Los Angeles. That’s
area code 213-486-2435.
|  A:And what’s the name of the person you want to speak to?
|  B:Susan Greene.

| 2.A:Operator. B:Yes, Operator. I’d like to place a person-to-person
call to Chicago. The number is 932-8647, but I don’t know the area code.

|  B:I’ll speak to anyone at extension 214.

| 3.A:Operator. B:I want to make a person-to-person call to
212-836-1725.

Cananda. The number is 932-0806.

|  A:Would you tell her Tom Gray called?
|  B:I’d be glad to.

| 2.A:Hello. Is Marie Ward there, please? B:I’ll see if she’s in. A:OK.
B:I’m afraid she’s not here.
|  A:Could you give her a message, please?
|  B:Yes, of course.

| 3.A:Hello. Is Mrs. James in, please? B:Hang on, please. A:All right.
B:I’m sorry, but I think she’s stepped out.
|  A:Would you ask her to call Larry Ruskin at 836-2550?
|  B:Certainly.

please. A:Thanks. B:She’s not at here desk right now.
|  A:Could you tell her to give Doug a call when she gets back? She has
my number.
|  B:Sure.

**(15).Asking for Directions 问路**

People are usually helpful when you ask for directions. You should try
to have the exact address and be as specific as possible. Telephone
directories are the most common sourse of addresses. Remember that many
cities and some towns are built in “blocks”. People will often tell you,
for example, to “go two blocks and turn right.”

| 1.A:Excuse me, Can you tell me where Main Street is? B:Turn left at
the second light and then go straight for two blocks. A:Is it far? B:No.
It’s only a five-minute walk.
|  A:Thanks a lot.
|  B:You’re welcome.

| 2.A:Excuse me. Could you please tell me how to get to the station?
B:Turn left at the first light. You can’t miss it. A:Will it take me
long to get there? B:No. It’s not far at all.

block and make a right. It’s right there. A:Should I take the bus? B:No.
It’ll only take about five minutes to walk.

|  B:Any time.

| 4.A:Pardon me. I wonder if you could tell me how to get to Mott
Street? B:Keep going straight for two blocks, then turn right o Elm
Street and you’ll run right into it. A:Is it too far to walk? B:Nl. It’s
only a little ways.
|  A:Thanks.
|  B:Sure. Have a good day.

**(16).Making an Appointment 预约**

It is usually necessary to make an appointment with a doctor, dentist or
lawyer. You should call as far in advance as possible.

| 1.A: Would Dr. Block be able to see me at 9:30 tomorrow? B: I’m sorry,
but she won’t have any openings until 11:00, unless there’s a
cancellation.
|  A: Would 1:00 be convenient?
|  B: Yes, she’s free then.

| 2.A: I wonder if the dentist could fit me in early tomorrow? B: I’m
afraid there’s nothing availavle before noon.
|  A: How about 12:45?
|  B: Sorry, but she’s busy then too.

| 3.A: I’d like to make an appointment with Professor Smith. Would 9:00
tomorrow be all right? B: I’m afraid not. She doesn’t have any openings
in the morning. A: Could I possibly make it early in the afternoon?
|  B: Nol That’s not good either. But give me your number and I’ll call
you if somebody
|  cancels.

| 4.A: Do you think the doctor could see me tomorrow before 9:30? B: She
won’t be in until 10:45, so the earliest would be 11:00.
|  A: How would 12:45 be?
|  B: Just a second. I’ll have to check.

**(17).On a Bus 在公共汽车上**

In cities, buses have letters or numbers indicating their routes.
Usually the exact fare is required because you can’t get change on a
bus. Long-distance travel by bus is common throughout the United States
and Cannda. It is an inexpensive, scenic way to travel. Special tickets
for unlimited travel are sometimes offered by the larger bus companies.

| 1.A: Does this bus go to the train station? B: No, You’ll have to get
off at the bank and take the A52.

**(18).Taking a Texi 乘出租汽车**

Taxi fares vary from city to city. In some cities, taxis have meters
that tell you the fare. For long rides, it is a good idea to ask in
advance what the approximate fare will be. This is especially true if
you’re taking a taxi from an airport. You should tip taxi drivers about
15% of the total fare.

| 1.A: Kennedy Airport, please. I have to be there by 7:00. B: I can’t
promise anything, but I’ll do my best.
|  B: OK. That’ll be $12.00, please.

|  A: Here.

**(19).At a Railroad Station 在火车站**

it many other parts of the world. Most train travel is in the “Northeast
Corridor” linking Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and
Washington, D.C. Special express trains called “Metroliners” travel
between New York and Washington, D.C. All seats on these trains are
reserved in both coach(2nd class) and club car(1st class). Long-distance
trains also serve major cities such as Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans,
Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Sleeping compartments

an extensive and rather complicated rapid transit system. Each train is
designated by a letter or a number, but most New Yorkers refer to them
by such names as the Broadway Local and the 6th Avenue Express. It is
important to remember that both local and express trains operate on some
lines. You must have a token or, in some cases, the exact change to get

through an operator to make person-to-person or cllect calls. You can
dial direct to many countries

an emergency, you should go directly to the emergency entrance of the
nearest hospital. Medical services in the United States are generally
very expensive.
| 
平时最好上别人推荐的医生那里去看病。紧急情况下，应该直接去最近医院的急诊室。美国的医疗费普遍昂贵。

| 1.A: I have a sore throat and my chest hurts. B: How long have you
been like this? A: Two or three days now. B: I think you’ve got the flu.
There’s a lot of it going around.
|  A: What do you think I ought to do?
|  B: Get this prescription filled and go straight to bed.

| 2.A: I have the chills and an upset stomach. B: How long have you felt
like this? A: For most of the week. B: It sounds as if you have a virus.

in a couple of days.

| 3.A: I feel dizzy and I have a headache. B: How long have you been
sick? A: Since yesterday. B: You seem to be generally run-down.

two.

You seem to have picked up some kind of infection.

**(43).At the Dentist’s Office 在牙医诊所**

| Dental work is usually quite expensive. Appointments are usually made
far in advance, but many dentists will try to fit you if you have an
urgent problem.
|  牙医行业通常索价高昂，而且看牙医一般都老早预约。
但是如果你有紧急情况，很多牙科医生还是会设法抽空给你看的。

| 1.A: How long have you felt like this? B: It started bothering me
yesterday afternoon. A: I think I’d better take an X-ray.
|  B: Can you see anything?
|  A: It’s a small cavity. It should be easy to fill.

| 2.A: When did your toothache start? B: It’s been this way for a few
days. A: Let me take a look at it.
|  B: What do you think?
|  A: You’re got an abscess. I don’t think we can save the tooth.

| 3.A: How long has it hurt? B: The pain started last night. A: Well,
let’s have a look.
|  B: What are you going to have to do?
|  A: Your gums seem to be inflamed. You’ll need treatment.

| 4.A: How long have you been in pain? B: It started to hurt when I was
eating dinner. A: Open your mouth as wide as you can, please.
|  B: How bad is it?
|  A: It’s quite serious. I’m afraid we’ll have to pull the tooth.

**(44).At a Drugstore 在药房**

| If you are talking medication regularly, you should take what you need
with you when you travel. You should also bring a copy of any
prescription that you are taking since many drugs are only available by
prescription. Drugstores, or pharmacies, sell cosmetics and toiletries
as well as many other products.
| 
如果你正在定时服药，那么在外出旅游时，应该随身携带所需药品。你也应该带上你正在服药的处方，因为有许多药只按处方供应。药房或药店还出售化妆品，梳洗用品及其它许多商品。

few minutes if you want to wait.
