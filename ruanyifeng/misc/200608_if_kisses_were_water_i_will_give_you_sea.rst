如果一个吻是一滴水，我给你整个的海

一位署名瓶子的网友，在\ `留言 <http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2006/08/sometimes_i_cry.html#comment-1349>`__\ 中引用了一段诗。

    | people laugh and people cry
    |  　
    |  some give up some always try　

    some say hi some say bye　

    others may forget you but never I

我很喜欢，在网上找到全诗，发现非常动人，觉得很有必要把全诗都贴过来了。

原诗没有标题，也不知作者。

**A beautiful poem**

| People live people die People laugh people cry Some give up some will
try
|  Some say hi some say bye
|  Some may forget you but never will I

| Feel good when somebody misses you
|  Feel better when somebody loves you
|  But feel best when somebody never forgets you

| Flowers need sunshine Violets need dew All Angels in heaven know I
need you Years may fly
|  Tears may dry
|  But my friendship with you will never die

| If kisses were water I will give you sea If kisses were leaves I will
give you a tree If you love planet
|  I will give you a galaxy
|  If friendship were life I will give you mine

| In my life I learned how to love to smile to be happy to be strong to
work hard to be honest to be faithful to forgive
|  But I couldn’t learn how to stop remembering you

| There are many stars but the moon is you There are many friends but
the best is you
|  To forget me that’s up to you
|  To forget you I will never ever do

| You may be out of my sight but not out of my heart
|  You may be out of my reach but not out of my mind
|  I may mean nothing to you but you will always be special to me!

P.S.

既然说到爱情诗，正好今天晚上在听Beatles乐队40年前的情歌，那就再贴二首歌词。

| I want you I want you so bad I want you
|  I want you so bad it’s drving me mad
|  It’s drving me mad

——**I Want You (She’s So Heavy)**

| You say yes, I say no. You say stop and I say go go go, oh no. You say
goodbye and I say hello
|  Hello hello
|  I don’t know why you say goodbye, I say hello

——**Hello Goodbye**
