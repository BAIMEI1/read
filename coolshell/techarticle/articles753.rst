    `Spotting the “Uncoachables” <http://www.marshallgoldsmithlibrary.com/blog/2009/05/02/spotting-the-uncoachables/>`__
    ====================================================================================================================

    Even if you are the best coach in the world, if the person you are
    coaching shouldn’t be coached, the coaching isn’t going to work. The
    good news is that the “uncoachables” are easier than you think to
    spot. How do you know when someone is uncoachable? How do you detect
    a lost cause? Following are four indicators that you are dealing
    with one of these people:

    **1. She doesn’t think she has a problem**.

    This successful adult has no interest in changing. Her behavior is
    working fine for her. If she doesn’t care to change, you are wasting
    your time! Let me give you an example of a nice woman who didn’t
    think she had a problem. My mother, a lovely woman and much-admired
    first-grade teacher, was so dedicated to her craft that she didn’t
    draw the line between inside and outside the classroom. She talked
    to all of us, including my father, in the same slow, patient manner,
    using the same simple vocabulary that she used with her
    six-year-olds every day. One day as she graciously and methodically
    corrected his grammar for the millionth time, he looked at her,
    sighed, and said, “Honey, I’m 70 years old. Let it go.” My father
    had absolutely no interest in changing. He didn’t perceive a
    problem. So no matter how much, how hard, or how diligently she
    coached, he wasn’t going to change.

    **2. He is pursuing the wrong strategy for the organization**.

    If this guy is already going in the wrong direction, all you’re
    going to do with your coaching is help him get there faster.

    **3. They’re in the wrong job**.

    Sometimes people feel that they’re in the wrong job with the wrong
    company. They may believe they’re meant to be doing something else
    or that their skills are being misused. Here’s a good way to
    determine if you’re working with one of these people. Ask them, “If
    we shut down the company today, would you be relieved, surprised, or
    sad?” If you hear ‘relieved,’ you’ve got yourself a live one. Send
    them packing. You can’t change the behavior of unhappy people so
    that they become happy: You can only fix behavior that’s making
    people around them unhappy.

    **4. They think everyone else is the problem**.

    A long time ago I had a client who, after a few high-profile
    employee departures, was concerned about employee morale. He had a
    fun, successful company and people liked the work, but feedback said
    that the boss played favorites in the way he compensated people.
    When I reported this feedback to my client, he completely surprised
    me. He said he agreed with the charge and thought he was right to do
    so. First off, I’m not a compensation strategist and so I wasn’t
    equipped to deal with this problem, but then he surprised me again.
    He hadn’t called me to help him change; he wanted me to fix his
    employees. It’s times like these that I find the nearest exit. It’s
    hard to help people who don’t think they have a problem. It’s
    impossible to fix people who think someone else is the problem.

    My suggestion in cases like these? Save time, skip the heroic
    measures, and move on. These are arguments you can’t ever win.

    | Life is good.
